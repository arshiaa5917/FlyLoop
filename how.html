      <h1>How FlyLoop Works</h1>
      <p style="color: var(--muted); max-width: 600px; margin-bottom: 18px;">
        Imagine you’re the customer. Instead of saving once a year and hunting
        for flights, you treat travel like Netflix: a predictable subscription
        that quietly builds your next escape in the background.
      </p>

      <h2>Your journey as a member</h2>
      <ul class="steps">
        <li><strong>1. You land on the site.</strong><br>
          You see three membership tiers with clear prices and destinations.
          You pick the one that matches how often you want to travel.
        </li>
        <li><strong>2. You create an account & choose a plan.</strong><br>
          After clicking <em>Join</em>, you would normally sign up, add your card,
          and confirm your subscription. From that moment, your “travel credits”
          or eligibility start building.
        </li>
        <li><strong>3. Your subscription runs quietly each month.</strong><br>
          Instead of one big, painful payment, a small monthly amount goes toward
          your trips. Think: “$49/month” instead of “$900 at once.”
        </li>
        <li><strong>4. You log in to your dashboard.</strong><br>
          Inside your account, you’d see your plan, how many trips you’re entitled
          to, and which destinations are currently available.
        </li>
        <li><strong>5. You browse available trip windows.</strong><br>
          The platform shows you future dates and destinations that match your
          plan: LA in March, Montréal in April, Cancun in October, etc.
        </li>
        <li><strong>6. You redeem a trip.</strong><br>
          When you’re ready, you choose a destination and date. FlyLoop
          (in a real version) would then handle the flight booking, hotel,
          and basic transfers.
        </li>
        <li><strong>7. You receive your itinerary.</strong><br>
          A few days later, you get your flight details, hotel confirmation, and
          a simple suggested itinerary so you don’t have to overthink the trip.
        </li>
        <li><strong>8. You travel.</strong><br>
          You fly, stay, explore, and return knowing that your subscription is
          still running—quietly building your next escape.
        </li>
        <li><strong>9. You manage your membership.</strong><br>
          You can view upcoming eligibility, see past trips, and—if this was live—
          request changes, pauses, upgrades, or plan switches from your account.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
        This page can act as a mini product spec. From a business POV, the flow
        implies:
      </p>
      <ul class="steps">
        <li>Recurring billing & subscription management.</li>
        <li>A “credits” or eligibility system tied to the plan and time.</li>
        <li>An inventory/calendar of available flights and hotels.</li>
        <li>A booking engine that locks in trips once redeemed.</li>
        <li>Rules for cancellations, pauses, and minimum commitment.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You can show this page in a pitch or portfolio to prove that the idea
        isn’t just a pretty UI — it has a clear customer journey and business
        logic behind it.
