    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    <p style="color: var(--muted); max-width: 620px; margin-bottom: 26px;">
      This page is written like a real product FAQ, but it also doubles as a
      way to explain your concept clearly to anyone viewing your portfolio.
    </p>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-q">Is FlyLoop live right now?</div>
      <div class="faq-a">
        No. This website is a concept and portfolio piece that shows how a
        subscription-based travel service <em>could</em> look and feel. It’s
        useful for user testing, business planning and investor pitches.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-q">Would flights and hotels actually be included?</div>
      <div class="faq-a">
        In a real version, yes. Each plan would include flights, hotels,
        basic transfers and curated suggestions, negotiated using wholesale
        travel rates and partner agreements.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-q">How do you stop people from joining, traveling once, and cancelling?</div>
      <div class="faq-a">
        Travel subscriptions usually rely on:
        <ul class="steps">
          <li>Minimum membership terms (e.g. 3–6 months before use).</li>
          <li>Trip credits that accumulate over time before redemption.</li>
          <li>Loyalty rewards for long-term members.</li>
          <li>Pause options instead of full cancellation.</li>
        </ul>
        Those same ideas can be built into FlyLoop’s model.
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
      <div class="faq-q">Can this model be profitable?</div>
      <div class="faq-a">
        Profit comes from negotiated rates, group departures, breakage (not
        everyone uses all trips), and upsells like extra nights, upgrades or
        tours. This FAQ can be expanded with financial modeling for pitches.
